# ADCmap
OsiriX  plugin code (mac-only, objective C) to calculate apparent diffusion coefficient from MRI DICOM images.

This code was developed for quick/easy ADC calculation from DICOM images.   
Other features including IVIM (fast and biexponential) fits and synthetic image calculation have been added.
Support for major vendor file headers is included and we try to update this as things change.
The developer is not an expert in DWI(!) so comments are welcome.
